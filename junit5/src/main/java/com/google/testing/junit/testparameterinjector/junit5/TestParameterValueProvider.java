   *     annotation is annotating a method, constructor or class, {@code parameterClass} is an empty
   *     optional.
   * @param testClass The class that contains the test that is currently being run.
   *     <p>Having this can be useful when sharing providers between tests that have the same base
   *     class. In those cases, an abstract method can be called as follows:
   *     <pre>
   *       ((MyBaseClass) context.testClass().newInstance()).myAbstractMethod()

   *     to being changed.
